## üß† Design Philosophy

- **Serverless-first**: minimize maintenance and maximize scalability  
- **Simplicity over complexity**: every component should be understandable at a glance  
- **Privacy and transparency**: all subscriber data is securely managed and never shared  
- **Built for creators**: empowering individuals to own their audience and messaging
